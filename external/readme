This part of the repo contains the external libraries necessary to to software.
The directories
bin
lib
share
man

are created by the compilation process of the external libraries. They
are NOT sored in the git repo. The user has to recompile the libraries
following the instructions.

Qhull

To compile qhull you can use the cmake system.  For simplicity, we
indicate with EXTERNAL this directory. In EXTERNAL yoou may launch
cmake-gui (or other software to compile cmake files).

-set the source code to $EXTERNAL/qhull-2012.1

-set the build path to $EXTERNAL/qhull_build

-check that CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set to $EXTERNAL

-check that CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER and CMAKE_C_COMPILER are set to the correct compiler

-choose Release as CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (to have optimizations activated!)

-generate the Makefiles (configure+generate in cmake-gui). 

-Enter in qhull_build/ and run make clean; make; make install

You can then run again make clean. The libraries and headers will be in $EXTERNAL/lib and $EXTERNAL/


EXCEPTION:

library gmm is formed just by header files, so i is stored in include/gmm/
GetPot is a header file and is stored in include/Getpot
