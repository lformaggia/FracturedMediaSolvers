COMPILATION INSTRUCTION

The software has been compiled on g++ V4.6.1 and is written in standard C++98.
It is provided with a simple Makefile

The steps to be followed are the following

make install will create in the ./lib directory both the static and the shared version of the library
make main_edfm creates the executable
make doc creates in the doc directory the reference manual (requires DoxyGen installed)
make clean cleans the object files
make clean_lib cleans the libraries
make clean_doc cleans documentation in the doc directory
make dist_clean cleans everything

make old_propertis is needed only for debugging: it uses an different technique to calculate properties"
 depending on the type of compilation desired

Inside the Makefile there are different lines that can be commented/uncommented to obtain different behavior:

# Optimised version
#OPTFLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG
# For debugging
#OPTFLAGS = -g -fno-inline

# Use verbose for extra info
#CPPFLAGS=-DVERBOSE

# Activate OpenMP
#OMPFLAGS = -fopenmp
# When debugging take away openmp
#OMPFLAGS = 

# Release version
#LDFLAGS= $(OPTFLAGS) 
# For development version we hard link the loading of shared libs
#LDFLAGS= $(OPTFLAGS) -Wl,-rpath=$(PWD)/lib -Wl,-rpath=$(PWD)/../external/lib
