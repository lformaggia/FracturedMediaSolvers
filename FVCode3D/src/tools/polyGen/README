First of all you need:
- tetgen 1.5.0
- OpenFOAM version 2.3.1

Follow the steps:
1) Install the OpenFOAM application to generate polyhedral mesh
    a) tar -xvf myPolyDualMesh.tar.gz
    b) mv myPolyDualMesh \
       <OpenFOAM231>/applications/utilities/mesh/manipulation
    c) source <OpenFOAM231>/etc/bashrc
    d) cd <OpenFOAM231>/applications/utilities/mesh/manipulation
    e) wmake
2) Set the tet2fvg.sh script
    a) set tetgen and OpenFOAM directory and executable

To run the program:
1) Set into tet2foam.txt file the 'mesh_file' variable.
   It is the input prefix name of the .poly mesh.
2) Set into foam2fvg.txt file the 'output_file' variable.
   It is the output prefix name of the .fvg mesh.
3) ./tet2fvg.sh <refinement> <prefix_input_file>
