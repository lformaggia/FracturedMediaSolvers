================================
Installation
================================

The simplest way to install FVCode3D is to run the install.sh script:
    ./install.sh --prefix=<install dir>
This will install both FVCode3D and its dependencies in <install dir>.
If --prefix is not specified, the default location is ../install.

Unless told otherwise, the install script will also install all the needed
packages (cmake, blas, lapack, suitesparse and eigen).
If you wish to use an existing installation of one of the packages,
its location can be specified with the option --with-<package>=<path>, e.g.:
    ./install.sh --prefix=<install dir> --with-cmake=/usr --with-blas=/usr

For a full list of options:
    ./install.sh --help

================================
Development installation
================================
The default installation install libraries, executables and headers to the
specified location, creates the documentation with doxygen and removes the
build directory. For development purposes these steps are not required.
One can simply use:
    ./install-devel.sh --prefix=<install dir>
This script install the development version, meaning that it will not delete
the build dir (by default located in <install dir>/build) and it wil not build
the documentation.

Alternatively, one can simply configure FVCode3D using CMake. This requires
BLAS, SuiteSparse and Eigen to be already installed:
    mkdir -p /path/to/build/dir
    cd /path/to/build/dir
    cmake \
        -DTPL_BLAS_DIR:path=/path/to/blas/install \
        -DTPL_SuiteSparse_DIR:path=/path/to/suitesparse/install \
        -DTPL_Eigen_DIR:path=/path/to/eigen/install \
        /path/to/source/dir
    make

To generate documentation use:
    make doc
