Installation
================================

To install the code run the install-devel.sh script:
    ./install-devel.sh
This will install both FVCode3D and its dependencies in ../fvcode3d-install.
To have the installation folder in <install dir> specify the option
--prefix=<install dir>, i.e.
    ./install-devel.sh --prefix=<install dir>

Unless told otherwise, the install script will also install all the needed packages:
cmake 2.8.12
blas 3.8.0
lapack 3.5.0
suitesparse 4.2.1
eigen 3.3.4
If you wish to use an existing installation of one of the packages,
its location can be specified with the option --with-<package>=<path>, e.g.:
    ./install-devel.sh --prefix=<install dir> --with-cmake=/usr --with-blas=/usr

For a full list of options:
    ./install-devel.sh --help

How to execute the program
================================

To run the program just type
	cd <install dir>/build/src
	./fvcode3d.exe
The data problem can be edited in the link <install dir>/build/src/data.txt and the available
meshes can be viewed in the link <install dir>/build/src/data.
To modify the forcing term, the boundary conditions and the properties (permeability, aperture, porosity)
the main program eniReservoir/FVCode3D/src/main.cpp must be properly modified. After that 
it's necessary to re-compile the code:
	cd <install dir>/build/src
	make
and then the code can be re-runned in the same previous way.

To run the examples:
	cd <install dir>/build/src/test
	cd <the test to be run>
	./<the test to be run>_test
where <the test to be run> = network1
							 network2
							 hexa
							 tet
E.g. to run hexa:
	cd <install dir>/build/src/test
	cd hexa
	./hexa_test
network1 and network2 are two examples with a complex network of fracture, hexa and tet are examples with
a theoretical solution in which the norm of the error for the pressure in bulk, pressure in fractures
and velocity is computed and printed out. The results are in .vtu format viewable with Paraview and
are the files sol_solution.vtu and sol_solution_f.vtu in the directory of the test, that is
<install dir>/build/src/test/<the test to be run>. To see the data problem in every example directory
there's a file data.txt and a main.cpp. The file data.txt can be modified and then the example can be
directly re-run. Whereas if main.cpp is changed then it's necessary to type
	make
before re-running the example.

How to generate the documentation
================================

The code is fully documented on Doxygen.
To build the doxygen documentation:
	cd <install dir>/build
	make doc
	cd doc/html
	<browser> index.html
where e.g. <browser> = firefox.
